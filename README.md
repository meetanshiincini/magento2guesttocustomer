Magento 2 Guest to Customer automatically converts a guest to a registered customer after the checkout step. The customer registration in the store improves the user experience in three ways: better customer service on each order improved on-site recommendations and merchandising faster checkout on subsequent orders. Requiring registration need not hurt the sales. It depends on how the registration is implemented. And that’s the benefit of Meetanshi’s Magento 2 Guest to Customer extension for Magento 2 store owners. Hence, a store owner can use a large customer database to enjoy its benefits and customers can altogether skip the tedious registration process and still enjoy the upgraded customer group benefits!
